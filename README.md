*Streak.txt* is a simple file format to track streaks (or lack thereof) of repeated tasks. Something like this -> 
âœ…âœ…âœ…â›”âœ…â›”âœ…

All your streaks are in future-proof plain text files on your disk. If you complete a task today append its date, if you didn't then don't enter anything.

Here's a sample:
