    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Streak.txt is a simple tool to capture your streaks. Each streak is
      tracked in a plain text file that you can edit with your favourite text
      editor. You can use it to capture your streaks, habits, or anything else
      you want to track.
    </p>

    <i>
      To organize the streaks better you can keep all your streak files in a
      "streaks" directory however this is not a requirement.
    </i>

    <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
    <p>
      To use Streak.txt, simply create a new plain text file in your favorite
      text editor and start capturing your streaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
        Suggestion #1: name your streak file "streak-&lt;activity&gt;.txt", for
        example streak-jumpingjacks.txt
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
        Suggestion #2: keep all your streak files in one directory. The
        reference tool assumes your default streak files folder is "~/streaks"
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Each line in the file represents a day. You can use any text editor to
      edit the file, including Notepad, TextEdit, or any other text editor.
    </p>

    <h3 id="entries">Entries</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        Each day you complete the task, add the date to the file. For example:
      </p>

      <pre>
2021-01-01
2021-01-03
2021-01-04
    </pre
      >

      <p>
        You can see in the example above that the task was completed on January
        1st, 3rd, and 4th, but not on January 2nd.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b> Note: The date is in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). </b>
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="streak-name">Streak Name</h3>

    <p>
      If you want to give a nice name to your streak, you can add a metadata
      block at the beginning of the file. The metadata block is a YAML front
      matter block. Here is an example:
    </p>
    <pre>
---
name: Jumping Jacks
---
2021-01-01
2021-01-03
2021-01-04
    </pre>

          <li>Track one streak per file.</li>
          <li>Changes to file are append only.</li>
          <li>Each streak file has some metadata.</li>
          <li>We can specify a name for the streak such as "Draw daily".</li>
          <li>
            We can specify the period of the streak such as "Monthly" or
            "Weekly".
          </li>
          <li>
            We can specify the tick of the streak such as "Daily" or "Hourly".
            The tick has to be a smaller time measure than the period.
          </li>
          <li>
            We can specify the expected frequency of the streak such as "10
            times", "7 times" etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            No entry is required when task is not done. In fact a missing entry
            qualifies as "Not done".
          </li>
          <li>
            We can specify an optional quantity when making an entry when task
            is done.

          <li>We can specify an optional comment when making an entry.</li>
