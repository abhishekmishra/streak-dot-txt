# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Streak.txt

## 1. Overview

**Streak.txt** is a simple, extensible tool and file format for tracking personal streaks, habits, or recurring activities. It uses plain text files for maximum portability and transparency, with optional metadata for richer tracking. The tool will provide both a reference implementation and a user-friendly command-line interface.

---

## 2. Goals

- **Track one streak per file** in a human-readable, append-only format.
- **Support metadata** (YAML front matter) for naming, period, tick, frequency, etc.
- **Allow flexible entry**: only record when the task is done; missing entries mean "not done".
- **Enable optional quantity and comments** per entry.
- **Provide a CLI tool** for managing, viewing, and analyzing streaks.
- **Support extensibility** for future features (e.g., reminders, integrations).

---

## 3. User Stories

### 3.1. As a user, I want to:
- Create a new streak file with a custom name and tick type (daily, weekly, etc.).
- Add a tick for today (or the current period) with optional quantity and comment.
- List all my streaks and see their current status, streak length, and averages.
- View detailed stats and a calendar visualization for a specific streak.
- Edit streak files manually in any text editor if desired.
- Store all streak files in a configurable directory.

---

## 4. File Format

### 4.1. Metadata (YAML Front Matter)
```yaml
---
name: Jumping Jacks
tick: Daily
period: Weekly   # Optional
frequency: 5     # Optional, e.g., 5 times per period
---
```

### 4.2. Entries
- Each line after metadata is an entry (ISO 8601 date) and represents a day the streak action was performed.
- If a date is missing, it means "not done" for that dayâ€”do not add explicit entries for missed days.
- Optionally, entries can include quantity, unit, and comment:
  ```
  2025-01-05 20 reps # Felt great!
  2025-01-07
  2025-01-08 5 km # Outdoor run
  2025-01-09 1.5 hours # Yoga session
  ```
- **Format:**
  - `YYYY-MM-DD [quantity unit] [# comment]`
  - Date is required. Quantity and unit are optional. Comment (after `#`) is optional.
  - The absence of an entry for a date means the action was not performed on that day.
- **Parsing:**
  - Split at the first `#` for the comment.
  - The first token is always the date.
  - If a second token exists and is a number, it is the quantity. If a third token exists, it is the unit.
  - Everything after `#` is the comment.

---

## 5. Technical Requirements

- Written in Python 3, using standard libraries and `rich` for terminal output.
- Cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows).
- Configurable streaks directory (default: `~/streaks`).
- **The Data Access Layer (DAL) will be implemented as a FastAPI application, providing a clear API for both the CLI and potential future web services.**
- **The CLI program will consume this FastAPI application for all streak operations.**
- Append-only file operations; never delete user data. Delete operations are soft deletes: streak files are moved to an archive directory, and entries are marked as inactive in the file. No user data is permanently deleted.
- Modular codebase for future extensibility.

---

## 6. High Level Design

### 6.1. Data Access Layer (FastAPI)

The Data Access Layer (DAL) will be implemented as a FastAPI application. This API will serve as the single source of truth for all streak data, handling file I/O, data validation, and business logic. The CLI tool will interact with this FastAPI application. The underlying storage will remain plain text files as defined in Section 4, with the FastAPI layer managing reading from and writing to these files.

#### 6.1.1. Core Entities & Pydantic Models

We'll use Pydantic models for request/response validation and serialization.

**Streak ID Generation:**
- The `id` is generated by slugifying the streak name (lowercase, spaces to dashes, alphanumeric only). This `id` is used as the filename and as the unique identifier in the API. The API and CLI both use this logic for consistency.

**Entry (Tick) Uniqueness:**
- Only one entry per date per streak is allowed. The entry `id` is the ISO date string. Attempts to add a duplicate entry for the same date will result in an error.

**Error Handling:**
- The API returns standard HTTP error codes: 404 for not found, 400 for bad requests, and 422 for validation errors. Error responses include a JSON message.

**Authentication/Authorization:**
- Authentication and authorization are not required for the initial local CLI version. These will be considered for future web or multi-user deployments.

**Concurrency and File Locking:**
- The application assumes single-user access. If concurrency issues arise, file locking or atomic write operations will be considered.

**tick_type vs. period Clarity:**
- `tick_type` defines the unit of recurrence (e.g., "Daily", "Weekly"). `period` and `frequency_in_period` are used for goals like "5 times per week". For example, `tick_type: Daily`, `period: Weekly`, `frequency_in_period: 5` means the user aims to tick 5 days each week.

**File Path Resolution:**
- The API returns the file path for each streak, or the CLI reconstructs it using the same slugification logic as the backend.

**Entry (Tick) Format:**
- Each entry in the file corresponds to a performed action. No entry means no action for that date.
- The API parses each entry line as:
  - `date` (required, ISO 8601)
  - `quantity` (optional, float)
  - `unit` (optional, string)
  - `comment` (optional, string, after `#`)
- Example parsing logic:
  - Split line at `#` for comment.
  - First token is date.
  - Second token (if numeric) is quantity.
  - Third token (if present) is unit.

**1. Streak:** Represents a single streak.
   - `id`: (str, e.g., `streak-jumping-jacks`) - Unique identifier, derived from the slugified name and used as the filename.
   - `name`: (str) - Name of the streak.
   - `tick_type`: (str, e.g., "Daily", "Weekly") - The frequency of the tick.
   - `period`: (str, optional, e.g., "Weekly", "Monthly") - The overall period for the streak.
   - `frequency_in_period`: (int, optional) - Expected number of ticks within the period.
   - `created_at`: (datetime) - Timestamp of creation.
   - `updated_at`: (datetime) - Timestamp of last update.

   *Pydantic Models for Streak:*
     - `StreakBase(BaseModel)`: `name`, `tick_type`, `period` (optional), `frequency_in_period` (optional)
     - `StreakCreate(StreakBase)`: For creating new streaks.
     - `StreakUpdate(BaseModel)`: `name` (optional), `tick_type` (optional), `period` (optional), `frequency_in_period` (optional)
     - `StreakResponse(StreakBase)`: Includes `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
     - `StreakDetailResponse(StreakResponse)`: Includes a list of `EntryResponse` and `StreakStatsResponse`.

**2. Entry (Tick):** Represents a single recorded instance of the activity.
   - `id`: (str, e.g., `2025-01-05`) - Unique identifier for the entry, typically the date.
   - `streak_id`: (str) - Identifier of the parent streak.
   - `date`: (date) - ISO 8601 date of the entry.
   - `quantity`: (float, optional) - Optional quantity associated with the entry.
   - `unit`: (str, optional) - Optional unit associated with the quantity.
   - `comment`: (str, optional) - Optional comment for the entry.
   - `recorded_at`: (datetime) - Timestamp of recording.

   *Pydantic Models for Entry:*
     - `EntryBase(BaseModel)`: `date`, `quantity` (optional), `unit` (optional), `comment` (optional)
     - `EntryCreate(EntryBase)`: For creating new entries.
     - `EntryUpdate(BaseModel)`: `quantity` (optional), `unit` (optional), `comment` (optional)
     - `EntryResponse(EntryBase)`: Includes `id`, `streak_id`, `recorded_at`.

**3. StreakStats:** Calculated statistics for a streak.
   - `total_days`: (int)
   - `ticked_days`: (int)
   - `unticked_days`: (int)
   - `current_streak`: (int)
   - `longest_streak`: (int)
   - `tick_average`: (float)

   *Pydantic Model for StreakStats:*
     - `StreakStatsResponse(BaseModel)`: Contains all stat fields.

#### 6.1.2. FastAPI Endpoints

**Streak Endpoints:**
- `POST /streaks/` -> `StreakResponse`: Create a new streak.
  - Request Body: `StreakCreate`
- `GET /streaks/` -> `list[StreakResponse]`: List all streaks (summary view).
- `GET /streaks/{streak_id}/` -> `StreakDetailResponse`: Get detailed information for a specific streak, including its entries and stats.
- `PUT /streaks/{streak_id}/` -> `StreakResponse`: Update an existing streak's metadata.
  - Request Body: `StreakUpdate`
- `DELETE /streaks/{streak_id}/` -> `{"message": "Streak deleted"}`: Delete a streak.

**Entry (Tick) Endpoints:**
- `POST /streaks/{streak_id}/entries/` -> `EntryResponse`: Add a new entry to a specific streak.
  - Request Body: `EntryCreate` (date will likely be part of the path or auto-set to today)
- `GET /streaks/{streak_id}/entries/` -> `list[EntryResponse]`: List all entries for a specific streak.
  - Query Params: `start_date` (optional, date), `end_date` (optional, date)
- `GET /streaks/{streak_id}/entries/{entry_date}/` -> `EntryResponse`: Get a specific entry for a streak.
- `PUT /streaks/{streak_id}/entries/{entry_date}/` -> `EntryResponse`: Update an existing entry.
  - Request Body: `EntryUpdate`
- `DELETE /streaks/{streak_id}/entries/{entry_date}/` -> `{"message": "Entry deleted"}`: Delete an entry.

**Stats Endpoints:**
- `GET /streaks/{streak_id}/stats/` -> `StreakStatsResponse`: Get calculated statistics for a specific streak.

This structure ensures that all data manipulation and business logic are centralized within the FastAPI application, promoting consistency and maintainability.

### 6.2. CLI Layer
- The CLI is a thin wrapper that calls the API for all operations.
- No direct file access in CLI code.
- The CLI only records performed actions; it does not allow explicit 'missed' or 'not done' entries.

#### 6.2.1. Commands
- `list`: List all streaks with summary (name, tick, current streak, today's status, etc.).
- `new --name <name> [--tick <type>]`: Create a new streak file.
- `tick --name <name> [--quantity <n>] [--unit <unit>] [--comment <text>]`: Add a tick for today. Only records performed actions.
- `view --name <name>`: Show detailed stats and calendar for a streak.
- `edit --name <name>`: Open the streak file in the default editor.
- `config --dir <path>`: Set or show the streaks directory.

#### 6.2.2. Output
- Rich terminal tables for summaries and stats.
- Calendar view for visualizing streaks.
- Clear error messages for ambiguous or missing streaks.
- CLI output and API both treat missing entries as 'not done'.

### 6.3. Web Service Layer (Future)
- A RESTful API (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI) will use the same data access API.
- Enables web, mobile, or other integrations.
